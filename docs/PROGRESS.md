# Progress log

## M0 — Foundations (accepted 2026-10-23: Gary delegated approval of practical/logical choices)

Done
- Plan written and approved (`PLAN.md`).
- Decisions recorded (`docs/DECISIONS.md`): D1–D5 accepted; D9–D19 made; D6 (tentative) and D7 decided; D8 open.
- Efficiency made a top-level goal (PLAN §1, §7A); benchmark gate moved to M4.
- Repo skeleton: git repository, Rust crate `basicc`, folders for source, devices, device
  generator, library, tests; vendor manuals moved to git-ignored `reference/`.
- `docs/LANGUAGE.md` draft 0.1, `docs/GRAMMAR.md` draft 0.1, `docs/ABI.md` outline.
- Reference compilers verified on this machine for the 18F27Q10 (first data point in PLAN §7A.4):
  XC8 v4.00 and Swordfish 2.2.5.0 both compile and report sizes.

Review items D11–D13, D16 and the missing-`Device` error were auto-approved as proposed. D6 (tentative) and D7 (IEEE binary32) were decided; D8 stays open until after M9.

## M1 — Fact base (done 2026-10-23)
- `docs/FACTS-18F27Q10.md`: memory map, Access Bank, stack, interrupts, instruction set, clock and
  configuration words, errata — each with a data sheet / errata / device-pack page cite.
- All "TO VERIFY (M1)" markers in `PLAN.md`, `LANGUAGE.md` and `ABI.md` resolved.
- Corrections found while verifying: the flash-write errata workaround is **two** NOPs (not one);
  `XINST = 1` makes the low 96 Access Bank bytes FSR2-indexed, so the default build uses `XINST = 0`;
  the unconfigured default clock is an *external* oscillator, so config words are always emitted
  explicitly; the part has fixed interrupt vectors only.
- Carried forward (listed in FACTS §9): `BRA` ranges (M4), bank 13 / NVM rules (M8), peripheral
  register maps (M6/M8), reset flags (M6).

## M2 — Device description (done 2026-10-23)
- Cargo workspace: `basicc` (compiler), `crates/devdesc` (schema, loader, validator, 7 tests),
  `tools/devgen` (pack → TOML generator and data sheet cross-check, 3 tests).
- `devices/18F27Q10.toml` generated from `PIC18F-Q_DFP 1.31.492`: 438 SFRs with bit fields (current and
  legacy names), 32 joined registers, 12 configuration registers with every setting value, 16 RAM
  banks (bank 13 flagged as system RAM), Access Bank ranges, vectors.
- `devices/18F27Q10.expect.toml`: values entered by hand from the data sheet (Table 1, Fig. 11-1, p.193).
  `devgen check` compares 15 values (memory sizes, vectors, peripheral counts) — all agree.
- Independent confirmation: the pack's `RSTOSC` encodings (`HFINTOSC_64MHZ`=000, `EXTOSC`=111, …)
  match data sheet Table 5-1 (p.53). A deliberately wrong expectation is rejected (checked).
- `scripts/check-devices.sh` regenerates each device and diffs it, then runs the cross-check.
- Pack quirks handled and documented in `docs/DEVICE-FORMAT.md`: non-memory-mapped simulator registers
  skipped; joined registers defined by byte members (pack widths unreliable, e.g. 22-bit `NVMADR`
  declared 16-bit); non-contiguous sectors refused rather than guessed.

## Next: M3 — Front end
Lexer, parser, AST and semantic analysis for the core language, per `docs/GRAMMAR.md` and
`docs/LANGUAGE.md`; the semantic pass resolves register names through `devdesc`.

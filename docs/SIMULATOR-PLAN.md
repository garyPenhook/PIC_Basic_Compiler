# Simulator plan (`basil-sim`)

A simulator of the PIC parts Basil supports, to replace MDB as the test oracle and to give the editor
extensions a debugger. Decisions D57 and D58 in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Starting point

* MDB (MPLAB X) is the oracle today (`tests/backend.rs`, `scripts/exec-test.py`). It is slow and closed,
  has no DMA or I2C host model, and has known deviations (D34, the Q41 double vectoring in D56).
* `scripts/picsim.py` is a PIC18-only Python simulator that parses the `.S` text, with a Q41 I2C1 host model.
  `scripts/dma_sim.py` is a DMA model attached to a live MDB session.
* `devices/*.toml` had no SFR reset values or access masks. The pack has them on every `SFRDef`
  (`por`, `mclr`, `access`, `impl`), and `_modsrc` names the peripheral IP block
  (e.g. `DOS-01631_tmr_mid0_v1_8bit_rev2`). Schema 0.2 records them (milestone S0).

## Decisions

* **Rust** (D57): crate `crates/picsim`, CLI `tools/picsim`. Reuses `devdesc` directly; the suite runs
  thousands of programs twice.
* **Cycle exact** (D58) for the cores and every peripheral model from the first milestone that has it:
  instruction timing, pipeline effects on skips/branches/table reads, interrupt latency, timer prescaler and
  synchroniser delays. `' cycles:` bounds and the benchmark harness (D18) rely on it. Every timing rule is
  cited to the data sheet; where the data sheet is silent the rule is marked `[A#]` and measured against MDB.

### Device data

`devdesc` 0.2 adds to each SFR the pack's raw `por`, `mclr`, `access` strings, the `implemented` mask and the
`module` (`_modsrc`). The strings are kept verbatim (one character per bit, MSB first); the simulator decodes
them, and the meaning of each letter is recorded with its source in `docs/FACTS-SIM.md` before it is relied on.
An SFR without a peripheral model is a latch honouring `implemented` and the read-only bits, and its first
access logs a warning, so no test passes silently on an unmodelled peripheral.

### Cores — `trait Core { fn reset(&mut self, kind); fn step(&mut self, bus: &mut Bus) -> Cycles; }`

Both decode the **hex** (what pic-as produced, not the assembly text), table driven, with a predecode cache
per program word.

* `Pic18Core`: base instruction set, the Q41 additions the emitter uses (`movffl`, ...), hardware stack depth
  from `memory.hw_stack`, shadow registers per `Target.hw_context` (D56), `TBLRD`/`TBLWT`.
* `Pic16ECore`: enhanced mid-range set, `BSR` banking, linear data memory through the FSRs, automatic context
  save, `MOVIW`/`MOVWI`.

Every flag, timing and edge-case rule goes into `docs/FACTS-SIM-<family>.md` with its data sheet cite.

### Bus and memory

Address decoding comes from the same TOML regions the compiler uses, so the two cannot disagree. SFR access
dispatches through an address table built at load time (latch, or hook into a peripheral for read side
effects and write-to-clear bits). Configuration words are read from the hex and handed to the models
(oscillator, watchdog, `MVECEN`, `LVP`).

### Peripherals

```rust
trait Periph {
    fn bind(dev: &Device, instance: &str) -> Option<Self> where Self: Sized; // finds its SFRs by name
    fn read(&mut self, reg: RegId, now: Cycle) -> u8;
    fn write(&mut self, reg: RegId, v: u8, now: Cycle, sched: &mut Scheduler);
    fn event(&mut self, ev: EvId, now: Cycle, sched: &mut Scheduler, irq: &mut IrqLines);
}
```

A registry maps module ids to model constructors; a part gets every model whose module it contains.
Models are event driven (no per-cycle tick) but schedule at exact cycles.

Order, by what `lib/` uses: timers 0/1/2, interrupts and ports → UART (TX capture, RX feed) → NVM/EEPROM and
flash write → ADC (fed values) → MSSP SPI/I2C, PPS, PWM/CCP → Q41 I2C host (ported from `picsim.py`) →
DMA (ported from `dma_sim.py`).

A `Stimulus` file (TOML) drives pins over time, UART RX bytes, ADC values, and I2C/SPI client models
(the models in `tests/exec_rtcc` and `tests/exec_pins` become clients).

### Interrupt controllers

One per family: PIC18 two-priority, Q41 with `MVECEN = 0` (D56; `MVECEN = 1` is `E-CONFIG`, so not needed
yet), PIC16 single vector with automatic context save. Vector addresses from `[vectors]`.

### Front ends

* CLI: `basil-sim prog.hex --device 18F16Q41 --until __halt --dump T_R1,T_R2 --cycles --trace --stim s.toml --vcd out.vcd`
  (symbols from the `.sym` pic-as writes).
* `exec-test.py --engine=sim|mdb`; `' expect:`, `' cycles:`, `' dma:` lines work unchanged.
* GUI: `tools/picsim-gui` (`basil-sim-gui`, egui): load a hex, Run/Pause/Step/Step over/Reset, breakpoints by
  clicking a disassembly line, registers, return stack, memory and SFR views, watch list, time at a given Fosc.
* Later: source-level stepping from the `-g` DWARF (`src/dwarf.rs`), and a Debug Adapter Protocol server for
  `vscode-extension`.

## Verifying the simulator

1. **Differential against MDB**: every `tests/exec*` program on both engines, `-O` and `-O0`; compare the full
   GPR snapshot and the cycle count at `__halt`. Known MDB deviations go in a cited allowlist.
2. **Instruction conformance**: generated opcode × flag edge-case programs, checked against the data sheet's
   instruction tables (like the `scripts/gen-*-tests.py` generators).
3. **Peripheral unit tests** from the data sheets' timing examples; `test_dma_sim.py` and `test_i2chw.py` carry over.
4. **Gate**: the simulator becomes the default engine only when the whole suite agrees with MDB;
   `BASIL_MDB=1` stays available.

## Milestones

| # | Deliverable | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| S0 | devdesc 0.2 (reset values, access, implemented mask, module), devgen, regenerated devices | `check-devices.sh` passes; compiler output byte-identical |
| S1 | Crate skeleton, hex + sym loader, `Pic18Core` cycle exact, latch SFRs, halt detection, CLI dump | peripheral-free `tests/exec` programs match MDB (RAM and cycles) on 18F27Q10 and 18F16Q41 |
| S2 | `Pic16ECore` | same on 16F17146, 16F13145, 16F18346, 16F15244 |
| S3 | Interrupt controllers, timers, configuration words | `' cycles:` and ISR tests pass |
| S4 | Ports, PPS, UART, ADC, stimulus file | `serial`, `adc`, `exec_pins` pass |
| S5 | NVM/EEPROM, SPI, I2C, Q41 I2C host, DMA | `exec_rtcc`, DMA and I2C tests pass; `picsim.py`, `dma_sim.py` retired |
| S6 | Trace, VCD, breakpoints, DWARF stepping, DAP | stepping a `.bas` file in the editor |

## Adding a part later

1. `devgen gen` → `devices/<part>.toml`, plus the hand-written `.expect.toml` (existing procedure).
2. Known core family and every module already in the registry: no code. Run the differential suite with
   `--device <part>`.
3. New peripheral IP block: one `Periph` impl registered under its module id, plus a FACTS section.
4. New core family (baseline PIC10/12, dsPIC, ...): one `Core` impl and interrupt controller; bus, scheduler,
   peripherals and front ends are shared.
5. `basil-sim --coverage <part>` lists the part's modules that have no model.

## Status

* S0 done (devdesc 0.2, regenerated devices).
* S1 done for the core: `crates/picsim` (hex loader, bus, `Pic18`, disassembler), `basil-sim` CLI, `basil-sim-gui`,
  `exec-test.py --engine sim|mdb|both` (DMA programs are skipped under `sim` until S5). Results and the rules
  relied on are in `FACTS-SIM.md`.
* Open for S1's "done when": the `both` comparison of cycle counts with MDB.
* Next: S3 (interrupt controllers, timers, configuration words), which clears most of the remaining failures.

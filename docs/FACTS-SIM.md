# Simulator facts (`crates/picsim`)

Each rule the simulator relies on, with its source. Rules marked `[A#]` are assumptions to be measured against MDB.

## PIC18 core (S1)

* Instruction encodings, flags affected and cycle counts: DS40002214G Table 45-2 (PDF pp.805-808). Cycles: 1; a
  taken skip adds the length in words of the skipped instruction (so 1-4); a taken branch, BRA, RCALL, CALL, GOTO,
  RETURN, RETFIE, RETLW, CALLW, MOVFF, LFSR, TBLRD, TBLWT take 2; MOVFFL takes 3.
* MOVFFL: source = word1<3:0>:word2<11:2>, destination = word2<1:0>:word3<11:0> (Table 45-2 field layout, read as
  most significant bits first) `[A1]`.
* LFSR literal: 14 bits (word1<3:0>:word2<9:0>) when FSRnH implements more than 4 bits (Q41), else 12 bits.
* When an instruction writes STATUS and also affects flags, the flags win (write happens first).
* A read-modify-write through `POSTINC/POSTDEC/PREINC/PLUSW` steps the FSR once (found by the `tests/exec` array
  programs, `addwf POSTINC0, f`).
* Access Bank: `f` below the length of `access_ram` maps to `access_ram.start + f`, above it to `access_sfr.start +
  (f - len)` (device file; matches the compiler's `Target`).
* The pack's `access` letters (`n r w c s -`) are **not decoded yet**: their meaning is not recorded in a data sheet
  here. Only the `implemented` mask is applied (unimplemented bits read 0 and ignore writes).
* Not modelled yet (milestone): reset values after MCLR/WDT, configuration words (S3 remainder), TBLWT / flash and
  EEPROM writes (S5), Q41 ADC (S4). SFRs without a model act as latches and are listed at the end of a run.

## Interrupts and timers (S3)

Code: `crates/picsim/src/pic18.rs` (`irq_check`, `retfie`), `periph.rs` (Timer0/1/2). Cites are in the module comments.

* Sources are every PIRn/PIEn/IPRn triple of the part. `IPEN = 0`: GIE (and PEIE for PIR1 and up on the Q10; PIR0 is
  ungated `[A5]`; the Q41 has no PEIE) enables all, vector 0008h. `IPEN = 1`: high needs GIEH, low needs GIEH and GIEL,
  vectors 0008h/0018h. DS40002043F 15.1-15.3 p.193-194; DS40002214G 11.5-11.8.
* Q10 entry clears GIE/GIEH (GIEL for low) and saves W/STATUS/BSR in the fast stack; `RETFIE` sets GIE/GIEH, or GIEL
  when leaving a low handler (p.194). Q41 (`SHADCON` present) leaves GIE alone, tracks the level itself, saves
  W, STATUS, BSR, FSR0-2, PROD, PCLATH/U per level and `RETFIE 1` restores them (FACTS-18F-Q41.md section 4).
* Entry timing, measured against MDB: the vector is reached 3 cycles after the cycle the flag was set, never less
  than 2 after the instruction `[A4]`. isr_single's first 27 entries and all `lib_timer*` cycle counts match MDB exactly.
* Timer0 8-bit compares TMR0L with the *live* TMR0H (a write right after the flag applies to the period that has just
  started; measured, MDB), period TMR0H+1 clocks; 16-bit buffers TMR0H. Timer1: FOSC/4 and FOSC, RD16 buffer.
  Timer2: free-running and software one-shot (MODE 00000 / 01000). Other clock sources, gates and hardware reset
  modes log a note and do not count/act (S4).
* Flag time agrees with MDB for software polling in all 12 probe variants (`[A1]`, `[A2]`).

### Known differences from MDB (the sim follows the data sheet)

* D-SIM-1: MDB loses part of the Timer0 prescaler count on a TMR0L *read* and on `movf T0CON0,f`. The data sheet
  clears the prescaler on writes only (DS40002043F 19.2.4 p.297), and `movf f,f` writes. Probe programs:
  `tests/hw/t0_*_sim.bas` (sim gives 402 / 401 / 500 / 401 for nowrite / readw / movf / tmr0l). `isr_single` differs by
  565 cycles because of it. Settle on silicon with the `_hw` flavours (results in EEPROM 0-1).
* D-SIM-2 (open): interrupt entry racing a `bcf INTCON,7` critical section differs from MDB by 1-8 cycles over a run
  (`bit_packed_isr` +4, `isr_dual` +2 total); MDB defers some requests the sim takes. Not yet understood.
* TMR0L read right after a TMR0H change in 8-bit mode differs by 1-2 counts.

## EUSART transmitter (S4, Q10 style)

Code: `periph.rs` (`Uart`), EUSART1 and EUSART2 (TXn/SPn/BAUDn names; the Q41 `Un*` UARTs are the next section).
DS40002043F ch.29 p.503-505.

* TXREG goes to the shift register at once when that is idle, else it is held until the Stop bit ends (29.1.1.2).
  TXIF = TXEN and nothing held (29.1.1.4); TRMT = shift register idle, read only (29.1.1.5). `RCIDL`/`ABDOVF` of
  BAUDnCON are read only and keep their value on writes.
* Character time in instruction cycles (Table 29-1): BRG16 = 1 and BRGH = 1: n+1 per bit; exactly one of them: 4(n+1);
  neither: 16(n+1); 10 bits, 11 with TX9. `[A6]` the held byte starts in the cycle the Stop bit ends.
  `[A7]` clearing TXEN abandons the shift register and a held byte; a TXREG write with TXEN = 0 is dropped.
  `[A8]` TXIF does not dip for a cycle after a write that goes straight to the shift register.
* Synchronous mode is not modelled (a note is logged; nothing is sent or received).
* `basil-sim` prints the transmitted bytes as `tx1: ...` / `tx2: ...`; `Periph::tx` holds (EUSART, start cycle, byte).

### Receiver (DS40002043F 29.1.2 p.507-510, RCxSTA 29.6.4 p.529)

* Two-character FIFO. RCIF = SPEN and CREN and an unread character (read only, follows the FIFO). FERR and RX9D describe
  the top character, so they change when RCREG is read. A third complete character with the FIFO full sets OERR and is
  lost; while OERR is set nothing more is received. Clearing CREN clears OERR; clearing SPEN also empties the FIFO.
* RX9 + ADDEN: characters with the ninth bit 0 are dropped without RCIF. RCIDL (BAUDnCON bit 6) is 0 while a character
  is in flight. A character whose Start bit falls while the receiver is off is lost (the hardware waits for the next
  falling edge).
* `[A9]` A character enters the FIFO when the Stop bit has been sampled, half a bit time into it: Start + data bits +
  half a bit time after the falling edge (9.5 bit times for 8 data bits). Not measured on hardware.
* `[A10]` Reading RCREG with an empty FIFO returns the last character read again (data sheet silent).
* `[A11]` Clearing CREN keeps the characters already in the FIFO (29.1.2.5 says they can still be read) and abandons the
  one in flight.
* RCREG is read by the instruction against the state after the previous instruction (peripherals sync once per
  instruction), so a character that completes inside the reading instruction shows up one instruction later.
* Auto-baud (ABDEN), break detection and the RX pin itself (RXxPPS, TRIS, ANSEL) are not modelled: the stimulus file
  drives the receiver input directly.

## UART of the PIC18-Q41 (S4, `periph/quart.rs`)

DS40002214G ch.34 p.519-566 (module `DOS-03076_uart_protocol_0_v1`), UART1..UART3 by register name (`U1CON0`, ...);
register layouts from 34.20 p.547-565. Asynchronous modes only (MODE 0 8-bit, 1 7-bit, 2 odd and 3 even parity in the
9th bit, 4 address). LIN, DMX, DALI (MODE > 4), auto-baud, break, wake-up, flow control and checksum are not modelled; a
note is logged when a program turns one on.

* Bit time in instruction cycles (Table 34-2 p.540, Fosc/4 per cycle): BRGS = 1: `UxBRG + 1`; BRGS = 0: `4(UxBRG + 1)`.
  `UxBRG` takes a write only while ON = 0 (34.20.8 note 2). A character is Start + 7/8/9 data bits + Stop (STP: 1, 1.5,
  2, 2 bit times, Table 34-1 p.536).
* Transmitter (34.2.1 p.519-520, 34.10 p.536): a `UxTXB` write goes to the shift register at once when that is free, else
  waits in `UxTXB` and moves at the beginning of the previous character's Stop bit; the next Start bit follows the last
  Stop bit. TXBE = buffer empty, TXBF = full, TXWRE (sticky, software clears) = write into a full buffer. TXIF = ON and
  TXEN and buffer empty. TXMTIF = shift register empty and idle, read only. Data written with TXEN = 0 waits in the
  shift register. TXBE = 1 written flushes the buffer (and an inactive shift register); a character being shifted
  finishes. ON = 0 discards everything. Address mode: a write to `UxP1L` sends the byte with the 9th bit set.
* Receiver (34.2.2 p.522-524, 34.8.1, 34.9 p.536): two-character FIFO. The character is stored in the middle of the first
  Stop bit (second with STP = 10); STPMD = 1 stores it at the end of the last Stop bit. RXIF = FIFO not empty and not
  suppressed by FERIF with FERIE or PERIF with PERIE. FERIF/PERIF describe the top character (PERIF = parity error in
  MODE 2/3, the 9th bit in MODE 4). A character completing with the FIFO full is lost and sets RXFOIF, which stays until
  software clears it. RXBE = 1 written flushes the FIFO. UxEIF = any `UxERRIR` flag with its `UxERRIE` bit.
* The stimulus file feeds it like the EUSART: `[[uart]]` with `port` = the UART number; `nine = true` sends the 9th bit
  (bit 8 of each `data` value) for the parity and address modes. Transmitted bytes print as `tx1:` ... as before.
* `[A18]` UxTXIF follows a write at once. Figure 34-3 p.521 marks "1 TCY" on it, which may be a one-cycle dip (a dip
  would matter only to code polling TXIF straight after a write; `lib/serial` polls TXBF).
* `[A19]` Clearing TXEN lets the character being shifted finish and starts no further one; a held character is sent when
  TXEN is set again. A `UxTXB` write with ON = 0 is stored and ignored.
* `[A20]` ON = 0 resets TXMTIF to 1, the error flags and TXWRE to 0 and empties both buffers.
* `[A21]` A character whose Start bit falls while the receiver is off (ON, RXEN, unsupported MODE) is lost. With RXFOIF
  set: RUNOVF = 0 stops the receiver (the character is lost), RUNOVF = 1 receives it and discards it. RXIDL is low from
  the Start bit until the character is stored.
* `[A22]` An empty FIFO reads the last character again. Address mode stores every character (address matching is not
  modelled; errata DS80000901H 1.5.2 says not to use the mode).
* `[A23]` A `UxTXB` write into a full buffer is dropped. In MODE 1 the top bit is not sent.
* Hardware-owned bits: TXMTIF, FERIF and PERIF of `UxERRIR` ignore writes (they follow the state); the other flags take
  the written value (R/W/S), so software clears RXFOIF with a write of 0. A `bsf`/`bcf` on `UxFIFO` writes TXBE and RXBE
  back as read, so on an empty buffer it flushes (the data sheet's note on `UxFIFO` says the same).
* `lib_serial` (Q41) passes on `--engine sim` as before; `tests/sim/run.sh` adds the library receiving three bytes and a
  framing error (`serial_rx_q41`) and sending two bytes with `SerialFlush` (`serial_tx_q41`, sim only: MDB never
  drains the Q41 transmit buffer).

## ADC (S4, `Adc` in `periph.rs`; Q10 only)

Basic mode of the ADCC, PIC18F27/47Q10 (DS40002043F ch.33). Other parts get a note ("the ADC of this part is not modelled")
until their timing is read from their own data sheet.

* ADGO = 1 with ADON = 1 starts a conversion (33.2.1 p.551). It lasts ADPRE + ADACQ ADC clocks (0 = not included,
  33.7.9 p.575, 33.7.10 p.576) plus **11.5 TAD** (33.1.4 p.549; the lib comments say 12). TAD = 2(ADCLK+1) Fosc periods
  (Table 33-2 p.549), so a conversion takes ceil((ADCLK+1)(2(ADPRE+ADACQ)+23)/4) instruction cycles.
* On completion (33.2.2 p.551): ADRES = new code (10 bits; ADFM = 1 right justified, 0 left justified, zero filled, Figure
  33-3 p.551), ADGO cleared unless ADCONT = 1 (then the next conversion starts at once), ADIF set. Clearing ADGO or
  ADON terminates the conversion and ADRES keeps its value (33.2.3 p.552).
* Input: the `[[adc]]` value of the channel in ADPCH at the end of acquisition (latest entry whose `at` has passed; 0 when
  none), clamped to the resolution.
* `[A12]` the conversion starts in the cycle of the instruction that sets ADGO; `[A13]` ADGO written 1 with ADON = 0 reads 0
  and starts nothing; `[A14]` an ADCONT retrigger starts in the cycle the previous conversion ended.
* Not modelled (note or ignored): FRC clock (ADCS = 1; ADGO never clears, with a note), computation (ADPREV, ADACC,
  filters, thresholds, ADTIF), triggers (ADACT), double sampling, ADCAP/guard/precharge polarity, the pin and ANSEL state.
* FVRCON: FVRRDY (read only) follows FVREN. `[A15]` at once; the data sheet gives only FVR04, a typical 25 us start-up
  (p.707), and the periph models do not know Fosc. A note is added when it is enabled.
* Tests: `crates/picsim/tests/adc.rs`, `lib_adc` and `lib_adin` on `--engine sim`.

## Ports and pins (S4)

* `PORTx` read gives the pin levels, a write goes to `LATx` (DS40002043F ch.17: the pin is read, the latch written). An
  output pin (TRISx = 0) shows its latch; an input pin shows what the stimulus drives, 0 when its ANSELx bit is set
  (digital input buffer off). A read-modify-write on PORTx therefore reads the pins and writes the latch, as on the part.
  `[A16]` An input nobody drives reads 0; weak pull-ups (WPUx), open-drain (ODCONx) and the input level thresholds are
  not modelled; a pin driven by a peripheral output (RxyPPS) is not either.
* Timer1 GVAL (T1GCON bit 2): the gate source after GPOL, for the pin source (T1GATE = 0, pin chosen by T1GPPS, reset
  RB5 on the Q10). `[A17]` MDB reads GVAL = 0 while GE = 0 and the polarity-adjusted pin level while GE = 1, whatever
  GTM, GSPM, GGO and ON are (probed on all combinations on a low pin); the data sheet says GVAL is unaffected by GE
  (DS40002043F 20.14.2 p.318). The model follows MDB. Other gate sources read as low, with a note. The gate does not
  yet stop the counter.

## Stimulus file (`crates/picsim/src/stimulus.rs`, `basil-sim --stim FILE`)

TOML; `[[uart]]` entries (`port`, `at`, `bytes` or `data`, `bit`, `gap`, `nine`, `bad_stop`), `[[adc]]` entries (`channel`, `value`, `at`), `[[pin]]` entries (`port` letter, `bit`, `level`, `at`) and `[[port]]` entries (`port`, `value`, `mask`, `at`); documented at the
top of `stimulus.rs`. Characters of one entry go out back to back; entries follow each other on the line. `at` is an
instruction cycle, `bit` the sender's bit time in instruction cycles (default: the receiver's own rate at the time the
character starts). `at`, `bit` and `gap` are capped at 2^32 cycles (larger values are a parse error). The stimulus is kept
and applied again after `Machine::reset()`. Tests: `cargo test --release -p picsim`, `tests/sim/run.sh` (a Basil program reading from it).

## Configuration words (S3)

Decoded by `crates/picsim/src/config.rs` from the bytes the hex puts at the `[[config]]` addresses; a byte the image
lacks keeps the register's unprogrammed default (0xFF). `basil-sim --config` prints the fields and the SFRs below.

* `RSTOSC` sets the reset values of `OSCCON1` (NOSC, NDIV), `OSCCON2` (COSC, CDIV) and `OSCFRQ`. Q10: DS40002043F
  Table 5-1 p.53; Q41: DS40002214G Table 12-1 p.175. 111 = EXTOSC, 110 = HFINTOSC 4 MHz / 4, 101 = LFINTOSC,
  100 = SOSC, 010 = EXTOSC + 4xPLL (OSCFRQ 4 MHz). **At 000 the tables differ**: NOSC/COSC = 110 with OSCFRQ 64 MHz on the
  Q10, NOSC/COSC = 000 with OSCFRQ 64 MHz on the Q41. 011 and 001 are reserved and change nothing.
* `WDTCON0` resets to PS = `WDTCPS` (01011 when `WDTCPS` = 11111), SEN = 0: DS40002043F 10.8.1 p.102, DS40002214G
  15.7.1 p.240. `WDTCON1` resets to WINDOW = `WDTCWS` and CS = `WDTCCS` (000 when `WDTCCS` = 111): DS40002043F 10.8.2
  p.103, DS40002214G 15.7.2 p.241.
* `MVECEN` = 1 on the Q41 (vector table, DS40002214G CONFIG3 p.46) is not simulated; the first interrupt taken adds a
  note and goes to the legacy vector. The compiler refuses `MVECEN = ON` (`E-CONFIG`), so only a program that leaves
  CONFIG3 out (default 0xFF = ON) and still takes an interrupt sees it.
* `WDTE` <> 0 adds a note: the watchdog does not time out yet (`CLRWDT` is a no-op). Needs reset kinds (next item).
* `LVP`, `STVREN`, `XINST`, code protection and write protection have no effect in the simulator.
* Not yet applied: `FEXTOSC`/`CSWEN` (`OSCCON1` is writable regardless of `CSWEN`), the OSCSTAT ready bits.

## Status (differential)

`scripts/exec-test.py --engine sim` (no MDB involved; the `' expect:` lines are the oracle):

* `lib_timer_hw` passes since the pin model (GVAL), with MDB's cycle count.
* Not yet run: `--engine both` (cycle counts against MDB), PIC16 parts (S2).
